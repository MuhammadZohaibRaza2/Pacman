# Pacman Game in Assembly

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of a unique rendition of the classic Pacman game, meticulously crafted in Assembly language. This project is the brainchild of **Muhammad Zohaib Raza**, a dedicated student with a passion for diving deep into the intricacies of low-level programming.

This version of Pacman brings the beloved arcade game to your computer screen, complete with sound effects and user-friendly prompts. The game features a score tracking system, dynamic levels, and interactive ghost movements, all implemented using the Irvine library.

Experience the thrill of dodging ghosts and collecting food, just like in the original game, but with the added satisfaction of knowing that every pixel on the screen is the result of carefully written Assembly code. Enjoy the game and feel free to explore the code!

## Game Features
- Sound effects using the `winmm.lib` library.
